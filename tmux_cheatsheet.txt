 +++   Copy Mode   +++
 =====================
Pressing PREFIX-[ 
places us in Copy mode. We can then use our movement keys 
to move our cursor around the screen. By default, the arrow keys work. 
We set our configuration file to use Vim keys for moving between 
windows and resizing panes so we wouldn’t have to take our hands off the home
row. tmux has a vi mode for working with the buffer as well. To enable it, add 
this line to .tmux.conf:

setw -g mode-keys vi
With this option set, we can use h, j, k, and l to move around our buffer.

To get out of Copy mode, we just press the Enter key. Moving around one character 
at a time isn’t very efficient. Since we enabled vi mode, we can also use some other
visible shortcuts to move around the buffer. For example, we can use w to jump to 
the next word and b to jump back one word. And we can use f, followed by any character,
to jump to that character on the same line, and F to jump backwards on the line.

+++++   Resizing Panes   +++++
==============================
With most of these the number (##) is optional and can be omitted to resize one line.

All of these can be bound to keys:

bind H resize-pane -L 5
bind J resize-pane -D 5
bind K resize-pane -U 5
bind L resize-pane -R 5
PREFIX-: resize-pane -D ##
PREFIX-:PREFIX-{arrow keys}   Moves left, right , up , down

Resize the current pane down by ## lines. The -D is optional since by default it moves down
Enter Command Mode;
PREFIX-: resize-pane -U ##  -   Resize the current pane up ## lines
PREFIX-: resize-pane -L ##  -   Resize the current pane left ## lines
PREFIX-: resize-pane -R ##  -   Resize the current pane right ## lines
PREFIX-: resize-pane -y ##  -   Resize the current pane to ## lines tall
PREFIX-: resize-pane -x ##  -   Resize the current pane to ## lines wide
